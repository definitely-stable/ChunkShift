"""Forward-only CSP v1 apply: a feasibility prototype for decision (h).

CSP-V1-CANDIDATE section 12 (h) leaves forward-only apply of the patch as a
later optimization. This prototype asks whether the v1 byte layout already
admits it: can an applier that reads the patch once, front to back, reach the
verdict of decode.py for every input, without buffering payload bytes?

The patch is read through ``ForwardSource``, which cannot seek and holds back
only the last 64 bytes (the TRAILER) so that it can tell where the sections
end. What the pass retains:

- PREAMBLE, the TCSM bytes and the section headers, CRCs and offsets;
- per PAYL entry its ChunkId, lengths, encoding and dictionary ChunkIds, never
  its stored bytes: those are decoded when they are read, in target order, and
  written to the output (standing in for the temporary file of D12);
- the PIDX entries (24 bytes each, as a materializing reader holds them) and
  the running FileDigest state.

Repeated target chunks are replayed from the output, reused chunks read from
the random-access base. No verdict is reached before EOF: the checks of
decode.py run afterwards, in its order, over what was retained, and the result
of the lockstep reconstruction counts only when every earlier stage passed.
Nothing is published before that, which section 6 step 8 already requires.

This is test tooling, not a second applier: it reuses decode.py's constants,
exceptions and zstd checks and differs from it only in how the patch is read.

Usage:
  forward_apply.py --vectors DIRECTORY   every vector of vectors.json: the same
                                         verdict, rule, failures and output as decode.py;
  forward_apply.py --compare DIRECTORY   every fuzz case (verdicts-*.jsonl, as for
                                         decode.py --compare): the same verdict as decode.py.
